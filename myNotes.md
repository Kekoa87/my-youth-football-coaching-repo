# 🏈 My Notes for the Youth Football Coaching Hub

> Internal planning, coaching standards, and program development notes.

## ✅ Coaching Logistics & Planning

### ⚠️ Key Planning Reminder
- **Coordinate with the Hawks the season *before* I plan to start coaching.**  
  Don't wait until mid-June — I need prep time.

### 🧠 Off-Offseason Focus (March–April)
- **Meet with all potential coaches *before* offseason begins.**  
  These are working sessions to align on expectations, values, and responsibilities.

---

## 🧭 Coaching Philosophy

### Core Beliefs
- **Every player must learn how to block and tackle.**  
  Fundamentals come first, regardless of position.

- **Offense > Defense (time allocation).**  
  Offense takes more reps and detail to install correctly.

- **No “daddy ball.”**  
  Players earn reps through effort, not last names.

## 🔥 Coaching Staff Expectations

### What I Expect from Coachesg
- **Commitment** – Time is valuable. Show up locked in.
- **Consistency** – Be present, prepared, and on time.
- **Energy** – Bring the juice. Kids feed off it.
- **Preparation** – Know your role, the install, and how to run your indy period.
- **Humility** – Be open to learning and growth.
- **Accountability** – If this isn't realistic for you, don't sign up. The kids deserve better.

### Pre-Season Prep
- Walk each coach through:
  - Our philosophy
  - How to run drills
  - How to install plays

#### Example – OL Coach
> You’ll learn how I want warm-ups run, how to teach stance, and how to install weekly run plays. No guesswork.

---

## 🧱 My Commitments as a Coach
- I coach every player with energy and purpose.
- I teach fundamentals first and prioritize safety.
- I aim to be a role model and build family trust.
- I help players understand the “why” behind every drill and play.

## 🚧 Development Notes

### Example – Offensive Line
> I coach the OL coach on stance, footwork, combo blocks, and communication. Nothing is assumed. Everything is taught.

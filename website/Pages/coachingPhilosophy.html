      <h2>My Coaching Philosophy</h2>
      <img src="../Images/CoachingPicture01.jpg" alt="Coach guiding youth football players on the field" />

      <p>As a youth football coach, I take my role seriously. I’m not just teaching the game — I’m shaping young athletes. My philosophy is built around discipline, structure, and a commitment to fundamentals. I want every kid to walk away more confident, more skilled, and more prepared for life, not just football.</p>

      <p>I believe every player must learn how to block and tackle. Fundamentals come first, no matter the position. I also prioritize offense in practice because scoring requires repetition and coordination, but defense is still taught with purpose.</p>

      <p>I do not run “daddy ball.” Every player earns their reps and roles based on effort and ability, not last names.</p>

      <p>This mindset comes from my background as a United States Air Force Veteran and former software engineer—both taught me the importance of preparation, structure, and leading by example.</p>

      <h2>Offensive Identity: Everyone Blocks</h2>
      <p>We run a run-first offense built on toughness and confidence. Blocking is key—not just for linemen but for every position. We focus on fundamentals like pad level, hand placement, and footwork. We strive for perfection in execution because discipline builds greatness.</p>

      <h2>Defensive Identity: Everyone Tackles</h2>
      <p>Our defense is aggressive, physical, and fast. We aim to disrupt plays, create turnovers, and make tackles for loss. Speed and smart play allow us to dictate the game’s pace.</p>

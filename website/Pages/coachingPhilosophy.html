      <h2>My Coaching Philosophy</h2>
      <img src="../Images/CoachingPicture01.jpg" alt="About Me" />
      <p>As a youth football coach, I take my role seriously. I’m not just teaching the game — I’m shaping young athletes. My philosophy is built around discipline, structure, and a commitment to fundamentals. I want every kid to walk away more confident, more skilled, and more prepared for life, not just football.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Every player must learn how to block and tackle.</strong><br>
        It doesn’t matter if they’re a skill player or a lineman — fundamentals come first. We’re building complete football players.</li>

        <li><strong>Offense will get more practice time than defense — and that’s non-negotiable.</strong><br>
        Scoring points requires repetition, precision, and coordination. Offense takes longer to teach, and that’s just the reality of the game. We’ll still install and teach defense with purpose, but our time allocation must reflect our priorities.</li>

        <li><strong>We do not run “daddy ball.”</strong><br>
        I take pride in the fact that most parents don’t even know which kid is mine. Every player earns their reps, their position, and their role based on effort, ability, and understanding — not last names.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I hammer the fundamentals because I believe failure on the field usually starts with what we didn’t teach well enough. I’m constantly learning, watching film, studying drills, and working to improve. I view their success as our success — and their failure as something I need to own and fix.</p>

      <p>That mindset comes from my background. I’m a United States Air Force Veteran and a former software engineer. Both worlds taught me that preparation matters, structure matters, and leading by example matters. I bring that same mindset to the field every time we coach these kids.</p>

      <h2>Offensive Identity</h2>
      <p>Everyone Blocks!!!</p>
      <p>At the youth level of football, we could have the best quarterback, the fastest running back, and the most athletic wide receivers in the league — but none of that matters if we can’t block. Everything starts up front.</p>

      <p>Our offensive philosophy is simple: identify and play the kids who give us the best chance to move the ball through their blocking ability. That includes linemen, of course — but also wide receivers who block on the edge, running backs who protect the ball and follow blocks with purpose, and quarterbacks who sell fakes and execute the play with discipline.</p>

      <p>We are a run-first offense, not because it’s safe, but because it builds toughness and confidence. We don’t need to get cute to move the football — we need to be sound, physical, and relentless. At the youth level, the teams that block better usually win. We don’t reinvent the wheel — we build it stronger.</p>

      <p>We focus on the fundamentals: pad level, hand placement, footwork, leverage, and timing. We rep these things every day because we know they’re what separate a good offense from a great one.</p>

      <p>We will strive to be perfect, and even if we fail, we’ll still be great. That’s our mindset. We chase perfection not for style points, but because greatness is built on discipline and execution. Everything we do — from our play design to our personnel choices — reflects that belief.</p>

      <h2>Defensive Identity</h2>
      <p>Everyone tackles!!!</p>
  
      <p>On defense, we want to be aggressive and relentless. We want to dictate the pace of the game and put pressure on the offense. We will play fast, physical, and smart. Our goal is to create turnovers, disrupt plays, and make tackles for loss.</p>

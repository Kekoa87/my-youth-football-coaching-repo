    <h2>Coach Kyle</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a United States Air Force veteran and former software engineer who found his passion in coaching youth football. Over the years, I’ve made it my mission to help kids succeed on and off the field by giving them a structured, supportive environment where they can learn, grow, and compete with confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site is a resource for coaches, parents, and players looking for specific drills to improve their skills by position. I’ve curated a growing collection of content based on my own research, coaching experience, and conversations with others in the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’ll be expanding our content to include more resources that support overall coaching development—things like practice planning, film study guides, and leadership tools. I'm excited to keep building this out for coaches at every level.
    </p>
    <p>
      I take coaching personally. I view the success of each kid as their own, but I carry their failures as my responsibility. That’s why I’m obsessed with improving, learning, and getting better. I spend a lot of time studying football, watching film, reading, and talking with other coaches. I’m always looking for ways to teach more clearly, structure practices better, and build stronger teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for visiting. I hope you find these drills and resources helpful in your coaching journey.

  <meta name="description" content="Tackling is one of the most important skills in youth football and must be taught with an emphasis on safety, technique, and control. Our drills focus on proper form—keeping the head up, wrapping up, and driving through the ball carrier—while building confidence and reinforcing good habits. These drills are designed to help players develop toughness and discipline without unnecessary risk">

    <h1>Tackle Drills</h1>/p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Author: <a href="/website/pages/about/about.html">Coach Kyle</a> | Created: June 03, 2025</p>
    <p>I struggled with finding video examples to go with some of these drills.  As I find or make video examples I will update this page.</p>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Stance</h2>
      <p>4 Key points to the stance:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Feet:</strong> Shoulder width apart, weight on balls of feet</li>
        <li><strong>Squeeze:</strong> Shoulder blades</li>
        <li><strong>Sink:</strong> Bend the knees, lower waist</li>
        <li><strong>Hands:</strong> Hands are ready to throw upper cuts</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Near Foot</h2>
      <p>Start in proper football stance. Call commands for either left or right foot to explode into the near foot stance.</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Swoop</h2>
      <p>Swoop is a good breakdown position as the tackler approaches the ball-carrier with the appropriate foot leading based on leverage. Like the ladder drill—either left to right or right to left—the leading foot matters. At the end of the bag, players freeze in place.</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Shoot</h2>
      <p>Start in a kneeling position behind a bag. Bend at the waist ("sink") and explode forward while throwing uppercuts ("hit").</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Give the commands: <strong>Sink</strong> & <strong>Hit</strong></li>
        <li>Hold up a number with your hand to ensure players keep their heads up</li>
        <li>Cleats should not be in the grass</li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Upper Cuts</h2>
      <p>Start in ready position with left or right foot lead. Drive for 5 yards using uppercuts.</p>
      <p>This can be done with a large exercise ball. Bounce the ball toward the tackler and have them perform the same drill. Increase difficulty by varying bounce angles.</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Near Foot Near Shoulder</h2>
      <p>Two players stand 5 yards apart. Ball carrier heads toward tackler holding the ball in front of their chest. Tackler leads with near foot and touches with near shoulder-side hand.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Near Hip</h2>
      <p>Set up three cones in a triangle. The runner heads to a cone while the tackler tracks them with correct foot lead, watching the runner’s hip. Start slow.</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Run & Gather</h2>
      <p>Tackler mirrors the ball carrier. When the ball carrier sinks hips, tackler gathers into a swoop to stay balanced and lateral.</p>

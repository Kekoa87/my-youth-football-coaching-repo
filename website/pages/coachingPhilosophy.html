      <h2>My Coaching Philosophy</h2>
      <img src="../images/CoachingPicture01.jpg" alt="Coach guiding youth football players on the field" />

      <p>As a youth football coach, I take my role seriously. I’m not just teaching the game — I’m shaping young athletes. My philosophy is built around discipline, structure, and a commitment to fundamentals. I want every kid to walk away more confident, more skilled, and more prepared for life, not just football.</p>

      <p>I believe every player must learn how to block and tackle. Fundamentals come first, no matter the position. I also prioritize offense in practice because scoring requires repetition and coordination, but defense is still taught with purpose.</p>

      <p>I do not run “daddy ball.” Every player earns their reps and roles based on effort and ability, not last names.</p>

      <p>As a head coach, I have to balance developing players with fielding a competitive team. The younger the kids are, the more I focus on equal reps and building a solid foundation. As they get older, it becomes a disservice to competitive players to hold them back — and a disservice to developing players to put them in situations they’re not ready for. That said, I take pride in helping every player improve. I coach my development players with just as much energy and purpose as anyone else, because growth is the goal for everyone on the roster.</p>

      <p>This mindset comes from my background as a United States Air Force Veteran and former software engineer—both taught me the importance of preparation, structure, and leading by example.</p>

      <h2>My Mission</h2>
      <p>My mission as a coach is to develop confident, resilient athletes who understand that success comes from effort, discipline, and being a great teammate—on and off the field.</p>

      <h2>Core Values</h2>
      <ul class="core-values">
        <li><strong>Effort Over Outcome:</strong> We can’t always control results, but we can control our attitude and hustle.</li>
        <li><strong>Respect & Responsibility:</strong> We respect the game, each other, and ourselves. We take ownership of our work and our roles.</li>
        <li><strong>Toughness:</strong> Both mental and physical toughness are earned through preparation and consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Team First:</strong> No job is too small. We block, we tackle, we support each other.</li>
        <li><strong>Growth Mindset:</strong> Mistakes are learning opportunities. Our goal is improvement, not perfection.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Coaching Commitments</h2>
      <ul class="coaching-commitments">
        <li>I will coach every player on the roster with energy and purpose.</li>
        <li>I will teach fundamentals first and prioritize safety always.</li>
        <li>I will strive to be a role model and build trust with families.</li>
        <li>I will make sure players understand the "why" behind what we do.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Offensive Identity: Everyone Blocks</h2>
      <p>We run a run-first offense built on toughness and confidence. Blocking is key—not just for linemen but for every position. We focus on fundamentals like pad level, hand placement, and footwork. We strive for perfection in execution because discipline builds greatness.</p>

      <h2>Defensive Identity: Everyone Tackles</h2>
      <p>Our defense is aggressive, physical, and fast. We aim to disrupt plays, create turnovers, and make tackles for loss. Speed and smart play allow us to dictate the game’s pace.</p>

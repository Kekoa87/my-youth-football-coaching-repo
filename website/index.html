      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is Kyle. I’m excited to create this webpage as a valuable
         resource for coaching youth football. This platform will serve as a 
         hub for drills, plays, and other coaching-related content, while also
         documenting my personal journey.
        </p>
      <p>I’ve been coaching youth tackle football since 2021. Prior to that,
         I gained experience coaching various sports like flag football, 
         basketball, T-ball, and coaches pitch baseball at our local rec center. 
         When my eldest son expressed interest in playing tackle football, 
         we enrolled him with the local club team known as the Hawks.
        </p>
      <p>Through my involvement with the Hawks, I developed a deep appreciation
         for the art of coaching. Curious to learn more about coaching tackle 
         football, I reached out to the team to inquire about my son’s head 
         coach. To my surprise, they informed me that he didn’t have a coach 
         yet and asked if I would be interested in taking on the role. After
         careful consideration, I reluctantly accepted the opportunity. Since
         then, coaching has been an absolute blast, and we’ve achieved success,
         which is always gratifying.
        </p>
      <p>I’m thrilled to share my knowledge, experiences, and insights on this 
         website to support fellow coaches and provide valuable resources for 
         youth football coaching. Together, we can make a positive impact on 
         young athletes and help them develop both on and off the field.
        </p>

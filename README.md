## MY NOTES
> I need a place other than my [website](https://tacticalyouthfootball.com/) to store internal notes.

* **Coordinate with the Hawks the season *before* I plan to start coaching.**  
  Don't wait until mid-June the same year I want to coach — I need time to prepare.

### Off-Offseason  
Thoughts and planning for the next round of coaching:

* **Meet with all potential coaches before the offseason begins (ideally in March/April).**  
  These meetings aren’t just to shake hands — they’re working sessions to align on expectations, values, and responsibilities.

---

#### My Coaching Philosophy

* **Every player must learn how to block and tackle.**  
  It doesn’t matter if they’re a skill player or lineman — fundamentals come first. We’re building complete football players.

* **Offense will get more practice time than defense — and that’s non-negotiable.**  
  Scoring points requires repetition, precision, and coordination. Offense takes longer to teach, and that’s just the reality of the game. We’ll still install and teach defense with purpose, but our time allocation must reflect our priorities.

* **We do not run “daddy ball.”**  
  I take pride in the fact that most parents don’t even know which kid is mine. Every player earns their reps, their position, and their role based on effort, ability, and understanding — not last names.

#### What I Expect from Coaches

* **Commitment.**  
  None of us are paid. We’re volunteering our time — which makes that time even more valuable. If I’m giving up time with my family, staying up late watching film, and planning every detail of practice — I need other coaches who are equally invested.

* **Consistency.**  
  I can’t run an effective practice if coaches are regularly absent, show up late, or are winging it. Kids notice when coaches aren’t locked in. That sets the wrong tone.

* **Energy.**  
  When we’re coaching, we’re *on*. Kids feed off our body language, our tone, and our attitude. If we don’t bring juice, neither will they.

* **Preparation.**  
  Each coach should know their role before every practice. If you're coaching WRs, you should know the install, the technique points, and how to run that indy period. If you're coaching OL, you should know the steps, rules, and calls for the weekly run play.

* **Humility.**  
  I’m not perfect, and I don’t expect anyone else to be. But I do expect us to be open to learning. If you’re unsure about something, ask. If you have ideas, speak up. We grow by learning together.

* **Accountability.**  
  If this level of commitment isn’t realistic for you — that’s okay. But then coaching might not be the right role. These kids only get so many years to play, and they deserve adults who take their development seriously.

---

#### Before the First Practice

* I will walk each coach through our philosophy, install plan, and expectations.
* We’ll review how to run your position group, teach your individual drills, and install plays the right way.
* Example:  
  **OL Coach** — You’ll learn how I want warm-ups run, how to teach stance and first steps, and how to install weekly run plays. We’ll review rules, terminology, and blocking assignments together. There should be no guesswork on the field.

---

This is a commitment — not just to football, but to these kids. They’re looking to us to lead. Let’s give them something they’ll remember.


**Example – Offensive Line:**
* I would coach the OL coach on exactly how I want them coaching the line — from warm-ups and footwork to combo blocks and communication.
